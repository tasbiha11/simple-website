            As gateways to knowledge and culture, libraries play a fundamental role in society. The resources and
            services they offer create opportunities for learning, support literacy and education, and help shape the
            new ideas and perspectives that are central to a creative and innovative society. They also help ensure an
            authentic record of knowledge created and accumulated by past generations. In a world without libraries, it
            would be difficult to advance research and human knowledge or preserve the world’s cumulative knowledge and
            heritage for future generations.

            Libraries are keenly aware of the need to maintain the balance between protecting the rights of authors and
            safeguarding the wider public interest. Copyright exceptions, which are currently under discussion in WIPO’s
            Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR), form an integral part of national copyright
            systems. They play an essential role in enabling the delivery of library services to the public and in
            achieving the copyright system’s goals of encouraging creativity and learning. This article explores the
            enduring importance of libraries and some of the intellectual property-related challenges they face.

            Libraries represent different things to different people – from a place where mothers can take toddlers to
            read their first stories and students can study, to a service allowing anyone to borrow a book, access the
            Internet or do research. Quite simply, libraries offer a means by which we can gain access to knowledge.

            Libraries are synonymous with education and offer countless learning opportunities that can fuel economic,
            social and cultural development. The inspiring story of William Kamkwamba from Malawi underlines the
            difference a library can make. Having borrowed a book about windmills from his local library, Mr. Kamkwamba
            learned how to build an energy-producing turbine for his village. On the strength of this experience he went
            on to study at a leading US university. That one book not only changed his life; it also transformed the
            lives of those in his village community. Such stories explain why many countries are eager to ensure that
            libraries continue to provide access to knowledge, learning and ideas.
